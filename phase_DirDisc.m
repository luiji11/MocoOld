function phase_DirDisc(mouseId) 

% This training phase utilized a dot and fan image pair stimulus % (Bussey
% et al., 2001) and required the mice to touch a specific target % stimulus
% on the screen to earn a reward. The target stimulus % was randomly
% presented on either the left or right side of the % screen with no more
% than three target stimuli appearing on the % same side sequentially.
% During the initial stage of this phase, no % mask was present in front of
% the screen in order to encourage % touching the screen. Touching the
% target image (dot) on the % screen earned the mouse a reward from the
% reward spout along % with a 1 kHz tone (1 s), while touching the
% distractor image % (fan) resulted in a Gaussian white noise sound (1 s)
% and the house % lights coming on for a timeout period of 10 s (Fig. 2c).
% After an % incorrect answer, a correction trial (Horner et al., 2013;
% Oomen % et al., 2013) was given in which the same stimuli were presented
% % on the same side of the screen. This was repeated until the animal %
% chose correctly. The correction trial helped to break any bias that % a
% mouse might have for one side of the chamber and thus prevents % the
% mouse from accepting a time out 50% of the time. % Only the initial
% answer to a stimulus presentation was counted % toward the percentage
% correct (correction trials were ignored). % Again in this phase, a new
% trial was immediately triggered upon % cessation of licking the reward
% spout. As a result, the stimuli % was present as soon as the mouse turned
% and faced the screen, % maximizing time for discrimination while also
% assuring the stimuli % were presented when the mouse was roughly
% equidistance % between the two choices. In order to advance to the next
% stage % of training, mice had to perform this task with 85% accuracy on %
% 200 or more trials in one hour for two consecutive training days % (Table
% 1). Mice were allowed up to a maximum of 10 training days to reach
% criteria. After reaching criteria, a dividing mask was added in front of
% the screen to more clearly delineate the two stimuli and allowed up to an
% additional two days to return to criteria (Table 1). In practice,
% performance improved on the task with introduction of the mask, with no
% mice in this study taking the maximum of 12 days to pass this stage of
% training (Fig. 3a) The average number of training days at this stage
% (without and with the mask) was 7.4 ± 1.3 (mean ± S.D.) training days
% (Table 1).
